         <h2 > CALISTHENICS WORKOUT</h2>

        Calisthenics are exercises you can do using your own body weight for resistance. They can be a great way to get back into exercise because you don't need special equipment or have to join a gym. The risk of injury from calisthenics is low. Calisthenics can provide a full-body workout, helping you build strength

<h2  style="color: blue;"   >Building Muscle with Calisthenics</h2>
<img src="images (1).jpg" alt=""
<br>
<p> A traditional complaint about calisthenics is that you can't build muscle with this type of exercise. However, the research on the issue is mixed. One study found that a push-up regimen could be as effective as bench-pressing in building muscle strength and size.

    The key may be modifying the exercise to increase the intensity, rather than just doing more repetitions.
    
    Calisthenics vs. weight training
    
    When you do calisthenics, you use the weight of your own body for resistance. In weight training, you use weights for resistance. That could mean a weight machine or free weights, such as dumbbells and barbells.   </p>

    <h2   style="color: blueviolet;"  >How Many Calories Do Calisthenics Burn?</h2>
    <img src="download.jpg" alt=""
<br>
     <p    style="color: darkred;"   >The number of calories you use while doing calisthenic may depend on factors such as your intensity, effort, weight, and age. 

        These numbers should be considered averages for calories burned while doing calisthenics for about 30 minutes:
        
        135 calories if you're 125 pounds <br>
        167 calories if you're 155 pounds<br>
        200 calories if you're 200 pounds<br>
        If you do vigorous calisthenics for half an hour, your calorie burn will be more like this:
        
        240 calories if you're 125 pounds<br>
        298 calories if you're 155 pounds<br>
        355 calories if you're 200 pounds<br>
        If you have health problems, get your doctor's OK before beginning a new exercise routine</p>
